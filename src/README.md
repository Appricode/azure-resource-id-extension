# Azure Resource ID Copy

This is a simple Chrome extension that allows users to copy the Azure Resource ID of the active tab to their clipboard.

## Features

- Copies the Azure Resource ID to the clipboard with a simple click.
- Lightweight and easy to use.

## Why I Developed This Extension

Developed this extension because, while working with Azure Resource Manager (ARM) templates, we often needed to reference Azure Resource IDs. Manually extracting the Resource ID from the Azure Portal was tedious and error-prone. This extension simplifies the process by allowing me to copy the Resource ID with a single click.

## Installation

1. Clone the repository or download the ZIP file.
2. Navigate to the `azure-resource-id-copy` directory.
3. Open Chrome and go to `chrome://extensions/`.
4. Enable "Developer mode" by toggling the switch in the top right corner.
5. Click on "Load unpacked" and select the `azure-resource-id-copy/src` directory.

## Usage

- Once the extension is installed, you can click on the extension icon in the Chrome toolbar to copy the Azure Resource ID to your clipboard.
- You can also use keyboard shortcuts (if configured) to trigger the copy action.
